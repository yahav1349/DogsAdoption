# DogsAdoption
## Overview
Our website dedicated to helping you find the perfect dog companion.
Our platform is designed to guide you through a comprehensive survey, enabling us to match you with the most suitable dog breeds based on your preferences.
Additionally, we extend our services by incorporating advanced algorithms, including both matching and natural language processing (NLP), leveraging an extensive dog breed dataset.

## Process:
1.Users are prompted to complete a detailed survey on the website, outlining their preferences and ideal dog characteristics.
2.Responses are transformed into tensors, and our sophisticated matching algorithm, coupled with NLP capabilities, is applied to compare user preferences with the available dog breeds in our dataset.
3.Utilizing web scraping techniques, a similar process is undertaken with dogs available for adoption on various adoption sites.
4.Users receive personalized recommendations, encompassing the most suitable dog breeds, as well as information on dogs available for adoption that align with their preferences.

## Our goal is to make the adoption process seamless and ensure that each user finds their ideal canine companion.
