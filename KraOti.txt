To execute the main program, you have two options available. Firstly, you can utilize the usual_main.py script,
 which should be executed once you have initialized the model and acquired the necessary .pkl files. 
Alternatively, there's the first_main.py script, which you need to execute initially to generate the .pkl files. 
This ensures that the model won't encounter extended runtime periods.

The initial execution and creation of the .pkl files typically require approximately 20 minutes, 
while subsequent runs using the pre-loaded model usually complete within a maximum of 20 seconds

The two running options: 
1. Initialize in case you don't have the .pkl files:
	At first:
	To utilize the part-of-speech tagging model so the preproccessing won't fail, it's only necessary if you're running the model from scratch without pre-existing .pkl files.
	In the pos_model.py script, within the _init_ method, you'll need to insert your Gemini API key into the genai.configure() function. 
	Specifically, it should be entered as follows: genai.configure([Your API Key])
	After you set every thing you may continue.	

	Enter anaconda powershell prompt
	Write:
	conda env create -n backEnd -f backEndFinal.yml
	conda activate backEnd
	cd algorithm
	python first_main.py

2. Run the backend in case you already have the .pkl files:

	Enter anaconda powershell prompt
	Write:
	conda env create -n backEnd -f backEndFinal.yml
	conda activate backEnd
	cd algorithm
	python usual_main.py

When you see: 
INFO:     Application startup complete.

Go to next step:
#make sure you have node js on your comp, if not, install it.

Open another (different) anaconda powershell prompt
Write:
conda env create -n react -f react.yml
conda activate react
npm install
npm start

Now you are able to use the site freely and get the model's findings based on your input.
